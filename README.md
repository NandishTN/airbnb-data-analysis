# 🏠 UK Airbnb Data Analysis | Python • SQL • Power BI

This project is an end-to-end data analyst portfolio project that explores Airbnb listings data to uncover pricing patterns, demand trends, and neighbourhood insights.

The goal of this project is to simulate real-world data analyst work by cleaning raw data, performing SQL analysis, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard.
